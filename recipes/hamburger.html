    <li>Prepare the patty: Combine ground beef, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix gently until just combined. Form the mixture into 4-ounce patties. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
    <li>Cook the patty: Heat a cast iron skillet or grill to medium-high heat. Add a little oil to the skillet. Cook the patties for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness.</li>
    <li>Assemble the burger: Toast your buns. Place a cooked patty on each bottom bun. Add your favorite toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and condiments. Top with the bun top.</li>
